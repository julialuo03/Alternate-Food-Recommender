# Alternate Food Recommender

By Julia Luo, Heidi Eren, Conor Doyle, Justin Wang

It is a python food recommendation system that returns alternatives to user-input foods based on similar nutritional values. We implemented various machine learning methods such as PCA and k-means clustering on a dataset with ~8.8k foods, each having 70 different nutritional attributes. In addition, we created various supplementary visualizations using the Plotly library.
